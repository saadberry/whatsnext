## Deployment 
- The server is hosted on Railway
- The webapp is hosted on Vercel
- For both deployments, the following process was done:
     - Connect GH repo to the respsective services
     - Configure directory
     - Once that's done, any subsequent push to the respective directories would trigger re-deployment
- The database is hosted on Railway as well
   - Connecting to DB from server:
       - Create Mongo project
       - Use Set `MONGO_URI` in variables of server to `PUBLIC_URL` of DB

## Design considerations
- The app is intentionally designed with simplicity in mind to minimize distractions, in hopes to allow users to focus on the core functionality, helping them complete their tasks.
- The title: "What's next?" aims to keep the user pushing, constantly asking themselves, "what's next?"
